# GRID-SEARCH-ON-ML-MODELS
"This repository contains my SVM implementation optimized with Grid Search as part of my Machine Learning A-Zâ„¢ course. It uses the [Social network ad] for a [Classification] task, leveraging libraries like scikit-learn. Key hyperparameters tuned include C, gamma, and kernel type, achieving an accuracy of [90.6] on the training set."
